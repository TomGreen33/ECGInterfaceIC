FinalReport.pdf contains my team's submission for the final project of our Micro and Nano Scale Electronics course (ENGG 4080). For this project, we were required to design 
an ECG interface for smart watch applications. In essence, the design had to contain an analogue multiplexer (to select a signal from various sources), a programmable gain 
amplifier (which could amplify the input signal but either 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on what the select signals are from a miroprocessor), as well as an 
analogue to digital converter (ADC). For this project, I mainly focused on the multiplexer, the programmable gain amplifier, and the cost estimation, while my
lab partner took care of the ADC. Overall I am quite proud of what was accomplished in this project, and it has truly sparked my passion for the deign of 
integrated circuits.

This is the work Riley McCarthy and I. I strongly discourage any form of plagarism from this project. I have uploaded my work to github to showcase my work 
to potential employers.
